Polynomials App
Overview
The Polynomials App is an Android application developed in Java that allows users to perform various operations on polynomials. The app supports adding, updating, deleting, and searching polynomials, all stored in a SQLite database. The user interface is designed for ease of use with clear activities for each function and real-time feedback through Toast notifications.

Features
Add Polynomials: Users can add polynomials by entering coefficients and powers. Each polynomial is assigned a unique ID.
Update Polynomials: Users can update the coefficient of a specific term in an existing polynomial by its ID.
Delete Polynomials: Polynomials can be deleted by their ID, with confirmation prompts for user safety.
Search Polynomials: Users can search for a specific polynomial by its ID and view the stored polynomial data.
View All Polynomials: Displays all stored polynomials, sorted by their unique ID.

Technologies
Android Studio: Used for app development and UI design.
Java: Core programming language used for implementing the appâ€™s logic.
SQLite: Database used to store polynomial data, enabling efficient data management.
